<h1>Yamuna & Monisha's Project Plan</h1>	

<h2>Overview</h2>	


Sleep is very important right? Despite this, college students choose to stay awake days on end willingly to run on only 3-4 hours of sleep at a time. Is this healthy, we know not. Yet, many of our peers still continue this routine, and somehow manage to attain good grades. So really is sleep all thaty important? We hope to uncover how sleep patterns influence academic performance and study productivity aong college students by integrating two distinct datasets. We want to undertsnad the direct effects of sleep on GPA, exam scores, and the indirect effects sleep has on study habits as well as productivity. We hope to uncover this answer through data analysis, incorporating ethical data handling, ensuring quality, integration, and automated reproducibility.  



<h2>Research Questions</h2>	

With this project we hope to answer our primary research question being "how does sleep patterns influence GPA and study productivity among college students?" Secondly, we hope to learn if sleep patterns such as sleep timing or bedtime consistency predict academic outcomes beyond total sleep duration. 




<h2>Team Responsibilites</h2>

Our team, consisting of Yamuna and Monisha, will collaborate closely throughout all stages of the project. We plan to work jointly on most parts of the workflow—from data acquisition and cleaning to analysis and reporting—to ensure shared understanding, equal contribution, and consistent progress. 

<h4>Monisha Mudunuri </h4>

Monisha will focus on integration datasets, managing the Github repository, and documenting the workflow to ensure reproducibility. She will take the lead on ethical data handling and guarantee that all code, processes, and analyses are clearly traceable 

<h4>Yamuna Nair </h4>

Yamuna will focus on data preprocessing, quality assessment, and managing the GitHub repository. She will also lead in maintaining the project’s version control, tracking progress through commits, and contributing to data integration and documentation.

Both team members have each identified distinct datasets related to sleep and academic performance, which will be merged and analyzed collaboratively. We will hold regular shared work sessions to review progress, align findings, and ensure equal involvement in analysis, writing, and presentation preparation.



<h2>DataSets</h2>
<h5>DataSet #1: CMU Sleep and GPA Dataset</h5>
Our first dataset that we have chosen is regarding CMU sleep and GPA. It was sourceed from Carnegie Mellon Univeristy Statistics and Data Science Repository. Its format is CSV. This dataset contains sleep and academic data from 634 first year college students across three universities being Carnegie Mellon, Univeristy of Washington, and Notre Dame. The study was about students wearing fitbit devices for one month during their spring semster to track sleep patterns. 

<h6>Key Variables:</h6>
-Sleep metrics: TotalSleepTime (minutes), bedtime_mssd (variablity), midpoint_sleep, and daytime_sleep

-Academic: term_gpa(0-4scale), cum_gpa, term_units

-Demographics: demo_gender, demo_race, demo_firstgen

-Data quallity: frac_nights_with_data

<h5>DataSet #2: Student Habits vs Academic Performance</h5>
This datset includes durvey data from 1,000 students captruing sleep habits, study behaviors, lifestyle factors, and academic performance. It is in CSV format. 

<h6>Key Variables:</h6>
Sleep: sleep_hours

Study Habits: study_hours_per_day, attendance_percentage

Distractions: social_media_hours, netflix_hours 

Lifestyle: diet_quality, excercise_frequency, mental_health_rating

Academic: exam_score

Demographics: age, gender, parental_education_level

<h2>Constraints</h2>	
Our project faces a couple constraints that we believe may mpact our interpretation if not addressed. First, the two datasets represent different student populations sampled at different time periods, which limits our ability to directly compare findings any may affect any generalizations. The metadata in the Kaggle dataset informas us that it relies on self-reported survey data, introducing potential response bias. Meanwhile the CMU dataset's objective Fitbit measurements are limited to students who consistently wore their devices. It is also a known constraint that since we are expected to finish the project within 10 weeks time, we are forced to using personal computing resources rather than high-performance computing, and must manage data dtorage carefully gicen Github's file size limitations. We also acknowledge that missing data in both datasets may reduce our effective sample sizes for certain analyses.
