How it was obtained (script, manual download, programmatic retrieval)
Ethical or legal considerations
Licensing restrictions
Terms of Use requirements
Personally identifiable information (PII) handling
Any de-identification steps
How the data fits into your analysis pipeline
Where it is stored in your repo, and where the output data from Box should be placed

<h2>Data quality</h2>	
(500–1000 words)
Summarize quality assessment:
Completeness (missingness patterns)
Consistency (format issues, schema mismatches)
Accuracy (validation checks, outliers)
Timeliness
