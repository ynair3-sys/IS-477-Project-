<h1>Yamuna and Monisha's Final Project</h1>	

<h2>Are Student's Sleeping on Success?
Modeling The Relationship Between Sleep Patterns and Academic Performance Among College Students</h2>	

<h2>Contributors</h2>	
  <li>Monisha Mudunuri </li>
  <li>Yamuna Nair</li>

<h2>Summary</h2>	
(500–1000 words)
Provide a clear, organized narrative covering:
What your project is about
Motivation (why this topic matters)
Research questions or objectives
High-level workflow (data acquisition → cleaning → analysis → visualization)
Key results or insights
Any important challenges you faced

<h2>Data profile</h2>	
(500–1000 words)
For each dataset, include:
Name of dataset
Source (API, website, generated internally, etc.)
Description (variables, schema, shape, time span, units)
How it was obtained (script, manual download, programmatic retrieval)
Ethical or legal considerations
Licensing restrictions
Terms of Use requirements
Personally identifiable information (PII) handling
Any de-identification steps
How the data fits into your analysis pipeline
Where it is stored in your repo, and where the output data from Box should be placed

<h2>Data quality</h2>	
(500–1000 words)
Summarize quality assessment:
Completeness (missingness patterns)
Consistency (format issues, schema mismatches)
Accuracy (validation checks, outliers)
Timeliness
Duplicates
Biases or sampling limitations
Tools used (profiling scripts, pandas checks, visualizations)
Actions you took to address issues
Cleaning steps
Transformations
Derived variables added
Conclude with the net impact on your analysis.

<h2>Findings</h2>	
(Up to ~500 words)
Describe final analytical results, including:
Key numerical results
Patterns/trends discovered
Visualizations (insert ![](path/to/figure.png) if including inline)
Interpretation—what the numbers actually mean
Any hypotheses supported or contradicted
Be direct and evidence-based.

<h2>Future work</h2>	
(500–1000 words)
Discuss:
Limitations (data, methodology, tooling)
What you would do with more time or better data
How workflow automation could be extended
Opportunities for deeper modeling or improved visualizations
Practical next steps for anyone continuing this project

<h2>Reproducing This Project<h2></h2>
A strict step-by-step workflow someone can follow start to finish.
