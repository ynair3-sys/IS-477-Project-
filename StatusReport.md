<h1>Yamuna & Monisha's Interim Status Report</h1>	

<h2>Overview</h2>	


Sleep is very important right? Despite this, college students choose to stay awake days on end willingly to run on only 3-4 hours of sleep at a time. Is this healthy, we know not. Yet, many of our peers still continue this routine, and somehow manage to attain good grades. So really is sleep all thaty important? We hope to uncover how sleep patterns influence academic performance and study productivity aong college students by integrating two distinct datasets. We want to undertsnad the direct effects of sleep on GPA, exam scores, and the indirect effects sleep has on study habits as well as productivity. We hope to uncover this answer through data analysis, incorporating ethical data handling, ensuring quality, integration, and automated reproducibility.
